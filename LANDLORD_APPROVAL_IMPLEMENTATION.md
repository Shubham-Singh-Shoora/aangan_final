# Landlord Approval System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive landlord approval system that transforms the rental process from direct booking to a proper approval workflow.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Updated RentalStatus Enum (`src/Aangan_backend/src/types/rental.rs`)
- **Added new statuses**: `UnderReview`, `Approved`, `Rejected` 
- **Enhanced workflow**: Requested â†’ UnderReview â†’ Approved â†’ Confirmed â†’ Active

### 2. Added New Methods to RentalAgreement
- `approve()` - Mark rental as approved
- `reject()` - Mark rental as rejected  
- `mark_under_review()` - Mark rental under landlord review

### 3. New Storage Functions (`src/Aangan_backend/src/storage/rental_store.rs`)
- `get_pending_rental_requests_by_landlord()` - Get requests awaiting landlord action
- `get_approved_rentals_by_tenant()` - Get rentals approved for tenant to sign

### 4. New API Endpoints (`src/Aangan_backend/src/api/rental_api.rs`)
- `get_pending_rental_requests()` - For landlords to view pending requests
- `get_approved_rentals()` - For tenants to view approved rentals
- `approve_rental_request(rental_id)` - Landlord approves request
- `reject_rental_request(rental_id)` - Landlord rejects request  
- `mark_rental_under_review(rental_id)` - Mark request as under review

### 5. Updated Confirmation Logic
- `confirm_rental()` now supports both landlord and tenant confirmation
- Tenants can only confirm approved rentals
- Landlords can confirm from requested or approved state (legacy support)

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Updated PropertyDetail.tsx
- **Changed "Rent Now" to "Request to Rent"**
- **New flow**: Creates rental request instead of direct agreement
- Added RentalService import and request functionality

### 2. Created RentalRequestCard Component
- **Location**: `src/Aangan_frontend/src/components/RentalRequestCard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays tenant request details
  - Status badges (Requested, Under Review, Approved, Rejected)
  - Action buttons (Approve, Reject, Mark Under Review)
  - Tenant profile viewing capability
  - Date formatting and status styling

### 3. Enhanced LandlordDashboard.tsx
- **Added "Rental Requests" section** before property listings
- **Features**:
  - Shows pending requests count
  - Lists all rental requests with status
  - Approve/reject functionality
  - Mark under review capability
  - Loading states and empty states

### 4. Enhanced TenantDashboard.tsx
- **Added multiple rental status sections**:
  - **Pending Requests**: Shows requests awaiting landlord approval
  - **Approved Rentals**: Shows rentals ready for agreement signing
  - **Active Rentals**: Existing functionality
- **Status badges** for different request states
- **Conditional actions** based on rental status

### 5. Updated RentalAgreement.tsx
- **Added approval check**: Only allows agreement for approved rentals
- **Enhanced data source**: Uses approved rental data for agreement terms
- **Improved flow**: Confirms approved rental instead of creating new request

### 6. Enhanced RentalService.ts
- **New methods**:
  - `getPendingRentalRequests()`
  - `getApprovedRentals()`
  - `approveRentalRequest(rentalId)`
  - `rejectRentalRequest(rentalId)`
  - `markRentalUnderReview(rentalId)`
